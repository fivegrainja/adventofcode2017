# adventofcode2017

Advent of Code is an anual coding challenge that occurs December 1st-25th each year. Each day there are two challenges. The first is unveiled at midnight, and upon successfully submitting the answer a user is presented with the second challenge. All users are presented with the same challenges, but input data is unique per user and so answers are unique per user as well.

# IMPORTANT

This code was developed as part of a contest with co-workers at the time. Scoring was based on how quickly we could produce the solutions. Also, most coding was done as soon as the questions were released, at midnight ET. As such the code is messy, ugly, without tests, without many comments... in other words it doesn't represent how I normally code. You've been warned :-)

There is a directory per day. Within that is a part1.py and part2.py corresponding to the two parts of the question each day.

Much of this code was written under time pressure, with too little sleep, in the wee hours of the morning, and frequently in conjuction with alchohol consumption. Under no circumstances should anyone think this code represents any sort of model for how to write good software.

I blame Herms for all of this.
